## Project Summary

This repository contains two main sections:

### 1. Practice Modules

### 2. Weather Checker App Backend
- A backend application built with TypeScript, Express, and SQLite.
- Features endpoints for weather data, history, and analysis.
- Intentionally includes insecure code and code smells to help users learn to identify and fix such issues.
